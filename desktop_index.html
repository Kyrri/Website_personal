			<h3>Backstory</h3>
			<p style='text-align: left;'> A family friend, Katherine Craine, is the proud owner of the Boston Terrier, Lily (featured in the pictures above). Lily was born with dwarfism; and as a result, over time she has begun to suffer worse and worse hip and leg displacement. Lily, who's greatest joy is playing fetch for hours on end, was soon unable to walk for more than short bursts. Wishing her dog to walk again, seeing that other options (dog wheelchairs already exist, but not ones for dogs this small and light) were unavailable, Katherine came to me for help. </p>
			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p style='text-align: left;'> The problem with Lily was unique to other dog wheelchair designs; Lily weighs 7lbs and is less than a foot long. A wheelchair for a larger dog can be quite heavy, but for Lily, the chair would have to be precisely sized to her body, and light enough for her to pull without expending too much effort. Luckily, Boston Terriers are known for having strong, powerful chests, and provide most of their strength and movement through their chests and front legs. It was also important to take into account that Lily was not entirely paralyzed in her back end; she was still capable of moving her back legs, potentially squirming out of the chair, and may feel uncomfortable or pained if the chair wasn't fitted quite right. </p>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<div style='text-align: left;'>
			<p><b> Making the Frame </b><p>
				<p>In order to have a lightweight frame, 3/4inch PVC pipe was used; although PVC pipe under 1inch is usually not strong enough to support a frame like this, the tiny size of each of the PVC pieces - the longest piece was 6.5inches long - removed the concern that the PVC would bend and become unstable, or even break, in the middle of the pieces where it recieves the most force. The PVC pipe was then painted in order to protect it from UV rays from the sun - UV degrades exposed PVC quite quickly. Red was used as the main colour on request.</p>
			<p><b>Connecting the Frame</b></p>
				<p>The frame was connected using PVC pipe corners and pipe glue; due to the small size the frame; the extra supporting PVC frame piece, viewable in the technical diagram as the 45 degree angled piece connecting the wheel to the frame, was unecessary; the frame was very sturdy, and this piece would only add more weight.</p>
			<p><b>Attaching the Frame to the Dog</b></p> 
				<p>Since the building of the wheelchair had to take place without Lily avaliable, and to make it easier for the owners to use, adjustable straps were implemented to strap the frame comfortably around her body. The straps eased most of the weight and force required to move the chair on Lily's powerful chest and shoulders, removing the weight and stress from her weaker hips and back legs. These straps were made out of large dog collars; already adjustable and sturdy with buckles to easily clip and unclip Lily from the wheelchair, these seemed like the perfect choice.</p>
			<p><b>Wheels</b></P>
				<p>The wheels had to be very lightweight and easy to pull; which is harder to find than one might expect. Ultimately, my dad was lucky enough to find a small pullcart at Goodwill; the thin, plastic wheels on this cart were perfect for Lily. They were attached to the frame using a home-made swivel mechanism made of short bolts, a nut to hold it in place, and some washers to add a buffer between the frame and the wheel, so they would not rub.</p>
			<p><b>Supporting the Legs </b></p>
				<p>Arguably the most difficult portion of this project was supporting Lily's back legs and hips, given that she can still feel in her hindquarters and move her legs. Initially, the straps supported her legs above the ground with a padded underbelly support on elastics; but after trial, this appeared to make Lily uncomfortable because her back legs were too restricted. She also had some trouble balancing. The straps were adjusted to sit across the front of her thighs, and were lengthened so her feet touched the ground. What this achieved is that Lily no longer held any of her weight with her back legs and hips, but she was comfortable and well balanced. The position was much more natural for her this way. The straps were made of a spandex-like cloth several layers thick wrapped around a thick banded elastic. This provided a bit of flexibility for Lily to move her legs if she so wished, while being comfortable on her back thighs.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p style='text-align: left;'>After a weekend of design, careful measurements, hard work, and much trial and error, a working version of Lily's chair was built. After solidifying the stitches on the leg supports and ensuring the structural integrity of the frame, the chair was delivered, and Lily has been happily mobile to this day. See the pictures above to see the design, progress, and the final prototype as well as the finished product in action!</p>
